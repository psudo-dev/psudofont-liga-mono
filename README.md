A pseudo Font Family born from a wish and a what if...

I wanted to use Menlo/Meslo Regular but I also wanted IBM Plex Mono/Lilex Italic... So what if I mixed and matched these two together?

Like so many other things, it started with an itch, and thus, this Frankenstein Font was born. It's aliiiiveeee!

## Motivation

I've tried several different fonts over the years but I kept using `Meslo` as my go-to font. I came across `IBM Plex Mono` and I also liked its height to base ratio, but it felt too square for me. On the other hand, its `italic` style was quite different from its `regular` style, but it was quite elegant.

So I tried for a bit to use [Lilex](https://github.com/mishamyrt/Lilex), but I didn't quite like it as much as I liked [Meslo](https://github.com/andreberg/Meslo-Font), but I really liked when the `italic` parts appeared in the code.

I tried to search for a configuration or maybe an extension that would allow me to use both fonts together, using the `regular` style of Meslo and the `italic` style of `Lilex`, but I couldn't find anything.

But then, it clicked! What if I fuse both fonts together? I know typography purists might be horrified by this aberration and they might point out all the reasons why this shouldn't be done, but... To be fair, like I said, the `italic` version of `IBM Plex Mono` is quite different from its `regular` version, so I thought that this `italic` version could be part of a different font altogether.

So why not? Don't they look like they belong?

## Credits

The version that I based on for Meslo is called `Liga Meslo LG M DZ`. It's a patched version of a patched version. It was patched to include `Powerline` glyphs, and then it was patched again to include ligatures. And unfortunately, I couldn't track down who did what for each patch.

![Terminal Example](./img/example_terminal.png)

The original `Meslo LG` is a customized version of Appleâ€™s `Menlo` font, which on the other hand is based on the open-source fonts `Bitstream Vera` and `DejaVu`. While `Lilex` is an extended font on top of `IBM Plex Mono`.

The work I've done is minimal compared to the original authors that created the fonts, so all the credits to them, I just had an itch...
